CLASS NOTES

- for font size use calc () only; take advantage of relative units
- wrap the body tag in the div tag and use that for the media query
- stay away from pixels
- use box sizing
- maker a folder for each page to hold both css and html
-  wrap a div tag around each element in the body (main, footer, nav and header) --> and give them id values


page-wrapper {
    width: 80vw;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

remove use of pixels in padding and margins

wrap nav and main into a div called 'container'

#container {
    width: 100%
    display:flex
    flex-direction: row
    position: relative
    background-color:
    visibility: hidden
}

media query should change flex-direction to column
height: 100vh
--> only change what you are overwriting

always start *{
margin: 0
box-sizing: border-box }
