            <p> Professional Projects </p>

            <p> Professional projects I have worked on include the restructuring of the Technical Architecture
                within the Data & Analytics team at ABB as well as establishing a new business strategy for how
                the Data and Analytics team interact with the business users of the data.</p>

            <p> Additionally, I assisted with analytical support on a Emissions data project for the
                Sustainability lead of Electrification. </p>

            <h2> Personal Projects </h2>

            <p> I am the current head for technology and development, as well as youth packages and engagement for
                a travel architecture company, <a href="https://cazavia.com">Cazavia</a>. </p>

            <p> I am redesigning the website in Q1  of 2025, as well as establishing a marketing plan to
                boost engagement and attract new customers. This is just a little bit of the work I am doing
                and plan to do to grow the business that is Cazavia. </p>
