            <h2> From a Personal Perspective </h2>

            <p> I am the proud dog mom of a one-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog, Poppy (or Popperino, Popperoni,
                Popster, Chicken Nuggest, Sweet Angel, Popsalot...depending on the day)! I love spending my free time
                snuggling her on the couch (she is a big snuggle bug) and watching a great show with my loved ones. I enjoy
                staying active and waking up early to keep up with my consistent morning routine. I am on a mission to
                limit my screen time (given the nature of my work) so I love winding down with a good book, a warm drink
                and my comfiest pajamas. I am learning an old skill - acoustic guitar - as I used to play in high school
                and enjoy the challenge beyond simply a deep love for music instilled in me from my dad. I am a traveler
                by heart but a creature of routine. There is so much more I could share but for now I will leave you
                with my favorite poem (courtesy of my dad): </p>

            <p> Out of the night that covers me, </p>
            <p> Black as the pit from pole to pole, </p>
            <p> I thank whatever gods may be </p>
            <p> For my unconquerable soul. </p>

            <p> In the fell clutch of circumstance </p>
            <p> I have not winced nor cried aloud. </p>
            <p> Under the bludgeonings of chance </p>
            <p> My head is bloody, but unbowed. </p>

            <p> Beyond this place of wrath and tears </p>
            <p> Looms but the Horror of the shade, </p>
            <p> And yet the menace of the years </p>
            <p> Finds and shall find me unafraid. </p>

            <p> It matters not how strait the gate, </p>
            <p> How charged with punishments the scroll, </p>
            <p> I am the master of my fate, </p>
            <p> I am the captain of my soul.</p>
